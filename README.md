# Unity Package Exporter
This library will export a series of files from a Unity3D project into a Unity Package (.unitypackage). This is very useful for **automated builds** of packages using _app voyer_. I use this myself on my [Discord Rich Presence](https://github.com/Lachee/discord-rpc-csharp) library so I dont have to rebuild the package every time.

## Usage
Now with the improved CLI provided by System.CommandLine, simply run the --help to get options.
```
-$ dotnet ../tools/UnityPackageExporter.dll --help
Description:
  Packs the assets in a Unity Project

Usage:
  UnityPackageExporter <source> <output> [options]

Arguments:
  <source>  Unity Project Direcotry.
  <output>  Output .unitypackage file

Options:
  -a, --assets <assets>                   Adds an asset to the pack. Supports glob matching. [default: **.*]
  -e, --exclude <exclude>                 Excludes an asset from the pack. Supports glob matching. [default:
                                          Library/**.*|**/.*]
  --skip-dependecy-check                  Skips dependency analysis. Disabling this feature may result in missing
                                          assets in your packages. [default: False]
  -r, --asset-root <asset-root>           Sets the root directory for the assets. Used in dependency analysis to only
                                          check files that could be potentially included. [default: Assets]
  -v, --log-level, --verbose <log-level>  Sets the logging level [default: Info]
  --version                               Show version information
  -?, -h, --help                          Show help and usage information
```

## Github Actions

Below is a GitHub action for packaging a Unity Package styled project (no Assets folder).
```yml

jobs:
  env:
    package_path: "~/lachee-utilities.unitypackage"
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v2

      # Install the packager. We are putting it outside the working directory so we dont include it by mistake
      - name: Install Unity Packager
        run: |
          git clone https://github.com/Lachee/Unity-Package-Exporter.git "../tools/unity-package-exporter"
          dotnet publish -c Release -o ../tools "../tools/unity-package-exporter/UnityPackageExporter"
        
      # Pack the assets
      - name: Package Project
        run: |
          echo "Creating package ${{env.package_path}}"
          dotnet ../tools/UnityPackageExporter.dll --project ./ --output package.unitypackage --exclude ".*" --exclude "Documentation"
        
      # Upload artifact
      - name: Upload Artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3.0.0
        with:
          name: Unity Package
          path: ${{env.package_path}}   
```

**NOTE**

We are doing a publish then running the dll to avoid .NET bugs involving running projects.


**IMPORTANT**

This package builder _requires_ the `.meta` files unity generates to properly pack the assets. If you are ignoring them in the .gitignore, this may cause issues such as incorrect import settings and broken links after the build. Please make sure you _allow .meta files_ in your repository.

## Dependency Analysis
This tool will automatically scan selected assets for dependecies. This is slow and can be inefficient if you are including everything within the glob pattern.
Use the `--skip-dependecy-check` flag to skip this check if you're including everything with the package anyways and/or don't mind if the package contains missing assets.

_The exclusion rule will still work on assets found with the dependency analysis._

## Maintenance
This is a project I am using personally. I made it soley for this project. If you have any issues please make a new github issue, but I might not respond. I dont plan to actively maintain this as much as I do with my other library.
